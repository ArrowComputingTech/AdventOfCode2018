# AdventOfCode2018

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

Since I'm learning to make games with Unity, I will be using Unity (and by extension, C#) to create solutions to the problems.
